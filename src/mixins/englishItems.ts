    title: "Starting Strength™",
    description: `Starting Strength™ is a complete strength training method developed by Mark Rippetoe.

    Workouts based on the Starting Strength™ method are suitable for both teens and adults who want to improve their physical fitness and their appearance and for seniors who want to maintain a high quality of life and autonomy in everyday activities. The method is based on compound exercises executed with a barbell and a  carefully designed program for rapid and safe strength gains.
    
    The main exercises are:
    
    ○ the low bar squat
    ○ the overhead press
    ○ the bench press
    ○ the deadlift
    
    These exercises were chosen, because they allow you to become stronger in a safer, faster and more effective manner than any other set of exercises. As you become stronger from the very start of the program, you will be lifting heavier weights each time you lift. Don’t worry, though: the starting weights and the increases are tailored to your initial fitness and strength levels.
    
    As you progress, additional exercises are added as needed, but you will spending most of your time squatting, pressing, bench pressing and deadlifting.
    
    Lessons of Starting Strength™ are conducted by our decent trainer 𝐏𝐢𝐨𝐭𝐫 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐳𝐲𝐤𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐤𝐢`,
